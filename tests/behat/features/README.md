# Sample feature files

The .feature files in this are meant to be a starting point for writing your own site-specific .feature files.

Feel free to delete the .feature files that come with this repo. They are present only as a reference and so that the first continuous integration builds have an automated test to run.

[A fuller guide on WordPress testing with Behat is forthcoming.](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues/2469)
